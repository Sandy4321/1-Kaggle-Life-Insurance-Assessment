# Kaggle - Prudential Life Insurance Assessment

This repo contains my work on the Kaggle "Prudential Life Insurance Assessment" contest. It was my first Data Science project and I started near the end date, so I didn't have neither the time, nor the skills to actually go very far with it at the time !

Current state: some basic data manipulation (one hot encoding, scaling) and usage of logistic regression.
Future work: this Kaggle competition is over, I have no current plans to work on this project again.
